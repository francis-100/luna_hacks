<summary><h1> Business Understanding </h1></summary>

<h2> Who is the client? </h2>
- The target user of this machine learning model is a farmer.

<h2> Needs of the client </h2>

1. To be able to make informed decisions regarding crop planting and harvesting.
2. To improve on food security.
3. To reduce on food waste.
4. To increase income for the farmers.
5. To be able to improve on farming techniques.
6. To be able to choose on better irrigation systems.
7. To be able to make informed decisions on the type of plant based on the soil quality.

## Client engagement process
 1. Machine learning team initially meet with the farmers.
 2. Data collection to understand the problem statement and the project scope and objectives.
 3. Analyzing and evaluating farmers information so as to develop a personalized strategy. 
 4. Implementing solutions and monitoring appropriate areas where the maize crop can yield.

## Project Objectives
* To develop a machine learning model that predicts crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa based on various factors such as:
    - Weather patterns
    - Soil quality
    - Irrigation systems
    - Farming techniques
